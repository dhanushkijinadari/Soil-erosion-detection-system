            <span> <b>Soil Erosion</b> </span>
            <p><i>“Soil erosion is the natural process in which the topsoil of a field is carried away by physical sources such as wind and water.”</i></p>
            <p>In this process, the soil particles are loosened or washed away in the valleys, oceans, rivers, streams or far away lands. This has been worsening due to human activities such as agriculture and deforestation.
                Soil erosion is a continuous process that occurs either slowly or at an alarming rate. It results in a continuous loss of topsoil, ecological degradation, soil collapse, etc.</p>
            <span>Causes of Soil Erosion</span> 
            <p><b>Rainfall and Flooding:</b> Higher intensity of rainstorms is the main cause of soil erosion. The raindrops disperse the soil, which is then washed away into the nearby streams and rivers. Regions with very heavy and frequent rainfall face a large amount of soil loss. The flowing water during floods also erodes a lot of soil by creating potholes, rock-cut basins, etc.</p> 
            <p><b>Agriculture:</b> The farming practices are the major cause of soil erosion. The agricultural activities disturb the ground. The trees are cleared and the land is ploughed to sow new seeds. Since most of the crops are grown during the spring season, the land lies fallow during winters. Most of the soil is eroded during winters. Also, the tyres of tractors make grooves on the land, making a natural pathway for water. Fine soil particles are eroded by wind.</p>
            <p><b>Grazing:</b> The grazing animals feed on the grasses and remove the vegetation from the land. Their hooves churn up the soil. They also pull out plants by their roots. This loosens the soil and makes it more prone to erosion.</p>
            <p><b>Logging and Mining:</b> A large number of trees are cut down to carry out the logging process. Trees hold the soil firmly. The canopy of the trees protects the soil from heavy rainfall. The leaf litter that protects the soil from erosion, is also lost during logging. Mining activities also disturb the land and leave the soil more prone to erosion.</p>
            <p><b>Construction:</b> The construction of roads and buildings exposes the soil to erosion. The forests and grasslands are cleared for construction purposes, which exposes the soil making it vulnerable to erosion.</p> 
            <p><b>Rivers and Streams:</b> The flowing rivers and streams carry away the soil particles leading to a V-shaped erosion activity.</p> 
            <p><b>Heavy Winds:</b> During dry weather or in the semi-arid regions, the minute soil particles are carried away by the wind to faraway lands. This degrades the soil and results in desertification.</p>
            <span>Effects of Soil Erosion</span>
            <p><b>Loss of Arable Land:</b> Soil erosion removes the top fertile layer of the soil. This layer is rich in the essential nutrients required by the plants and the soil. The degraded soil does not support crop production and leads to low crop productivity.</p>
            <p><b>Clogging of Waterways:</b> The agricultural soil contains pesticides, insecticides, fertilizers, and several other chemicals. This pollutes the water bodies where the soil flows. The sediments accumulate in the water and raise the water levels resulting in flooding.</p>
            <p><b>Air Pollution:</b> The dust particles merge in the air, resulting in air pollution. Some of the toxic substances such as pesticides and petroleum can be extremely hazardous when inhaled. The dust plumes from the arid and semi-arid regions cause widespread pollution when the winds move.</p>
            <p><b>Desertification:</b> Soil erosion is a major factor for desertification. It transforms the habitable regions into deserts. Deforestation and destructive use of land worsens the situation. This also leads to loss of biodiversity, degradation of the soil, and alteration in the ecosystem.</p>
            <p><b>Destruction of Infrastructure:</b> The accumulation of soil sediments in dams and along the banks can reduce their efficiency. Thus, it affects infrastructural projects such as dams, embankments, and drainage.</p>
